"""
Live KHL data: standings from en.khl.ru (the league's own official site, bot-protected,
fetched via Playwright), fixtures + results from Sofascore's public JSON API (a genuine
alternative source Mr Eric pointed at directly). Both feed data/khl-live.json in the
same {standings, fixtures, results} shape as the UAE Pro League scraper.

HISTORY, in order (all 2026-09-01 through 09-04):
1. Fixtures/results were never actually built despite the module existing since
   inception -- main() always wrote fixtures:[] and results:[] with a log line
   admitting it. Season starting 2026-09-05 forced this to actually get built, not
   just re-verified. Also removed a duplicate `def main()` shadowing the real one.
2. khl.ru's standings page had been redesigned since the original 2026-08-17 build --
   old .championshipRegular-table__* classes were gone. Fixed via a real captured row
   from a live diagnostic run: team name is now in .table__cell--team-name, 9 plain
   stat cells follow in gp/w/otw/sow/sol/otl/pts_pct/l/pts order, then a combined
   "GF-GA" cell (a real goals-against column exists now, unlike the old design).
3. Tried building fixtures/results the same way as UAE/Arsenal -- anchor on the 22 real
   team names inside khl.ru's own calendar page. Three rounds of diagnostic capture all
   confirmed zero team names exist anywhere in the default Playwright-rendered
   snapshot, at all -- a hidden date-picker widget was found defaulted to "May 2025",
   meaning the real game list needs further JS interaction (date selection, or an
   internal API call) this script wasn't performing. Abandoned rather than ship a
   guess against a page that provably has no match data in its initial render.
4. Switched to Sofascore instead. Confirmed directly (not bot-blocked at all, and its
   own page text surfaced "KHL next match is Lokomotiv Yaroslavl v Traktor Chelyabinsk"
   on first fetch -- real, current data). Sofascore runs a well-documented public JSON
   API (api.sofascore.com/api/v1/...), widely scraped by others. One documented gotcha:
   it TLS-fingerprints plain HTTP clients, but this script already drives a real
   Playwright/Chromium browser for the standings fetch, so the fixtures/results fetch
   reuses that same real-browser navigation (page.goto() to each JSON endpoint,
   mimicking an actual user visiting that URL) rather than a bare request library,
   which should carry an authentic fingerprint the block can't easily catch.
