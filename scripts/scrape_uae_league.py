Live UAE Pro League data: standings + current matchday's fixtures and results.

Source: worldfootball.net's all-matches page (not the base competition page -- confirmed
directly, 2026-08-18, that the base page was stuck showing only Matchday 1 even though
Matchday 2, 3, and 4 were already published with real dates on the all-matches page; the
"auto-shows current matchday" assumption this scraper originally relied on turned out not
to hold). The all-matches page has the full published schedule plus the same standings
table, so this fixes the root cause rather than working around it.
Chosen over the official uaeproleague.ae site because the official site's standings/
fixtures are rendered client-side via JS (confirmed directly: fetching it returns a
"Loading..." spinner and "No records" placeholder, not real data).

Replaces the hardcoded SPORTS_LEAGUES entry for UAE Pro League in index.html, which had a
fixtures array with no results array at all -- meaning nothing ever moved from fixtures to
results once matches were played, no matter how much time passed.

UPDATE 2026-08-31: parse_matches was rewritten. It had been finding 0 matches (standings
still parsed fine, since that function walks every <tr> generically) -- the div[data-match_id]
+ .team-name-home/-away + data-datetime attributes it depended on evidently no longer matched
the live page, confirmed by directly re-fetching the page. Rewritten to anchor on
/match-report/co1183/.../maNNNNNNN/home-slug_away-slug/ links and adjacent team-badge
<img alt="Team Name"> elements instead -- both are semantic/URL-level details far less likely
to break with a CSS/markup refresh than specific class and data-attribute names. Date is
tracked from the visible DD.MM.YYYY header text instead of a data-datetime attribute, since
that attribute'''s continued existence could not be confirmed either.

Output: data/uae-league-live.json, matching the same {teams, fixtures, results} shape the
client already knows how to render (see uzMatchToRow's row shape in index.html).
